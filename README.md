# Awesome pure OOP

This repo contains a list of links to the best resources and books about pure object-oriented programming.
Pure object oriented programming means the following:
- objects are self-contained entities which communicate with each other by sending messages to each other (in terms of mainstream languages 'by calling methods')
- objects provide a limited set of services and their internals can not be controlled from outside
- no getters/setters
- no static methods
- objects, that contain state, must be immutable
- etc.
